# CROSS FIT API
- In these project, I will use the best practices I learnt so far in my career as a software engineer


# Architecture
- In this project I will be using a 3 - Layer Architecture, namely:
 - Router
 - Controller 
 - Service Layer
 - Data Access Layer

## Definitions
 - ### Router 
    - Holds Functionality from express that passes requests to the corresponding controller
 - ### Controller
    - Holds functionality for handling all stuff that is related to HTTP. That means we're dealing with requests and responses for our endpoints.
 - ### Service Layer
    - Holds the business Logic that is exported for use in the controller
 - ### Data Access Layer 
    - Holds all functionality that has to do with the database operations
